		<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello I am Charles louis B. Bisnan I live in tondo <sup>1</sup>. I do not remember much of my early childhood.<sup>2</sup> I used to watch cartoons like spongebob, Avatar: The Last Airbender and Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog. <sup>3</sup> 
        I also watch some anime such as Naruto and Dragon ball.<sup>4</sup> I studied at <cite>Isabelo delos Reyes Elementary School. </cite><sup>5</sup> Back in the day, I was an active and knowledge-seeking child.<sup>6</sup> 
        I wanted to be a seafarer back then.<sup>7</sup> But it all change when I started playing <cite>Counter Strike and Point Blank</cite>. <sup>8</sup> I was amazed by how games are created. <sup>9</sup> I'm also fascinated by animation. <sup>10</sup>
        I study hard and spend my spare time watching documentaries about ships and playing video games.<sup>11</sup>  I was passionate about Math and Science. <sup>12</sup> This passion helped me gain a profound knowledge of these areas. <sup>13</sup> My favorite childhood picture is my family photo <sup>14</sup>
        The first time I played a computer game was the most memorable day of my life.<sup>15</sup> My role model was my Father. <sup>16</sup> One event that shaped who I am today was the first time I watched a tournament. <sup>17</sup>
        My main belief in life is Honesty. <sup>18</sup> Honesty is a quality of a person with good moral values. I believe if you have honesty, then you stay true to yourself which is very important. <sup>19</sup> I myself, have a very strong conscience. I first learned lying was wrong as a young kid <sup>20</sup>

		<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a high school student, staying on track with my goals and maintaining motivation can be difficult. <sup>1</sup> These years can be crucial and memorable for me. <sup>2</sup> 
            as I begin to navigate more difficult seasons in their journeys while still being emotionally underdeveloped. <sup>3</sup> Self-reflection and journaling are both excellent ways to increase self-awareness.<sup>4</sup>  about my life-changing experiences and lessons thus far. <sup>5</sup>
            I may be young and ambitious, but I believe that even teenagers should pause and reflect on their academic careers. <sup>6</sup> I could be more successful if I set goals and reviewed our high school routines.<sup>7</sup> 
            Being a happy student would be impossible without the support of my family. <sup>8</sup> . I am extremely fortunate to have the most supportive parents. <sup>9</sup> My father works as a sailor, and my mother is a housewife. <sup>10</sup>
            They work hard to support our family and try to spend as much time as they can bonding with us. <sup>11</sup> My family places a high value on loyalty and responsibility.<sup>12</sup> This is why I always try to be truthful with my family and inform them about my academic activities.<sup>13</sup>
            This is also why I believe that if more young people are honest with their parents. <sup>14</sup> they will have fewer difficulties achieving their academic and extracurricular goals.<sup>15</sup> Living with a supportive family inspires me to aim high and achieve good grades and a successful career.<sup>16</sup> 
            Every day when I go to school, I attend all of my classes in order to learn and expand my knowledge.<sup>17</sup> I believe that there are insights to be gained from each lesson.<sup>18</sup> Some teachers do not explain some of the lessons well. <sup>19</sup>
            but I always strive to understand our lessons with the resources I have.<sup>20</sup>

		<p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also enjoy spending time with my friends as a college student.<sup>1</sup> I hang out with the gang in between classes and sometimes after. <sup>2</sup>
            We enjoy trying new restaurants, going to the movies, having light conversations, and playing games.<sup>3</sup>We attend class events together and, with a few others who share a common interest, we participate in club activities.<sup>4</sup>
            I sometimes have difficulty balancing time for family, studies, and friends.<sup>5</sup> I can recall numerous occasions when I chose to spend time with my peer group over doing my homework or studying for a test.<sup>6</sup>
            I've learned the hard way that time management is a necessary skill that I must hone in order to pace myself well in pursuing my goals.<sup>7</sup> I make a point of writing down any terms that I don't understand so that I can look them up later in the library or online.<sup>8</sup> I've decided to become a programmer.<sup>9</sup>
            I keep myself motivated by watching coding videos on YouTube.<sup>10</sup> I keep track of my schedule in order to manage my time for homework and games with friends.<sup>11</sup> HTML was the first programming language I learned in high school.<sup>12</sup>
            because I haven't decided on a primary job yet. <sup>13</sup> I chose to learn the fundamentals in college.<sup>14</sup> and hope to be able to decide what job I want after graduation.<sup>15</sup> I am currently considering a career as a web developer or in cybersecurity.<sup>16</sup> But for the time being, I'm concentrating on my subjects.<sup>17</sup>
            and learn various programming languages.<sup>18</sup> Even if I fail repeatedly, I will keep on going. <sup>19</sup> It is nearly impossible to achieve success without strong internal motivation.<sup>20</sup>
